This repo is a sort-of catch-all for any project I did during my time at Berks
Career and Technology Center that didn't particularly stand out.

We mainly did Visual Basic .NET + WinForms in our class, however, we also branched
out into VBA, Python, C++, Java, and more.

This also contains some Access databases I did for the class as well.

import ExtLink from "@components/ExtLink.astro";
export const components = { a: ExtLink };

This was a simple website for the Berks Dental Assistant Society.
It was made with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and
uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling.
I created a CMS for it as well that allowed admins to edit site content without code.

It also supported the [ICalendar protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar)
so users could sync the organization's calendar with their own.

Sadly plans fell through to actually host the project, but otherwise,
it's fully functional.

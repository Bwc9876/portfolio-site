Bingus was an idea from an online friend. He utilizes a Markov chain (trained on the chat history of a Discord server) to respond randomly to messages.

At a high level, Markov chains are very bad autocomplete, think the top three suggested words your phone gives to you when typing as a bot.

For how simple he is, he provides a lot of fun to the people he chats with. He always has something weird or funny to say!

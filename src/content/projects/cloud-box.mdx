CloudBox was a project for <ExtLink href="https://technica-2023.devpost.com/">Technica 2023</ExtLink>. 

It runs instances of a virtual machine on Google Cloud Platform, and allows users to manage and remote into them through a web interface.

The web interface was made in Django and used Bootstrap for styling. The backend was written in Python and used the Google Cloud SDK to manage the virtual machines.

The remote connection was made using WebSSH, which is a web server that uses WebSockets to connect to a remote server.

It was a good first hackathon experience, and I learned a lot about web development and cloud computing. 
I also learned a lot about how to work in a team, and how to manage a project.

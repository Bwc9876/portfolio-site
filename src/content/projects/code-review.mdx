import ExtLink from "@components/ExtLink.astro";
export const components = { a: ExtLink };

Code Review was my senior project in my trade school. It's an intranet site that
students could use to grade other students' programs.

It was made because oftentimes students need their code reviewed to continue to
the next topic but the instructor may not always be available to do so.

It uses Active Directory to authenticate users and auto-syncs with it over time.
It also features a leaderboard for friendly competition.

It was made using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling.

This was my first "real" product; that is, something users would need to interact
with and use in the real world. It took some time to plan and work out the
details with my instructor, and changes were needed after the project was
officially done, but it turned out to be very handy.
...Although some of my classmates may have taken
the leaderboard a bit too seriously ðŸ˜….

It has many tests, flowcharts, data flow diagrams, and ERDs
[available in the GitHub repo](https://github.com/Bwc9876/CodeReview/tree/master/concept).

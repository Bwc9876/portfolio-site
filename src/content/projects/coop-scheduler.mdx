import ExtLink from "@components/ExtLink.astro";
export const components = { a: ExtLink };

This program was a favor for one of the teachers in my school, she needed a
program that generates a schedule automatically for students
following some simple rules.

It uses the concepts of [Wave Function Collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse)
to generate the schedule, for more info check out the program's [README](https://github.com/Bwc9876/Coop-Schedule#readme).

In all I'm happy to have done this, I go to learn some algorithms and experiment
with bitwise arithmetic. The UI could have been more tactful, but for WinForms, I'm
satisfied with how it came out.

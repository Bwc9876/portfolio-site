DGANG (Dear God, Another Nix/NixOS Guide) is a short project I did because currently I think that Nix/NixOS documentation is lackluster.

It utilizes an amazing feature of NixOS that allows for easy VM creation to teach the reader how to use it without needing to install another distro.

The guide teaches Nix/NixOS from a practical standpoint, explaining how to get stuff done first and only then explaining how the underlying system works.

After a lot of reading, the last 2 chapters go into actually installing the distro and how to use NixOS on a real system.

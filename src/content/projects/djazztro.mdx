import ExtLink from "@components/ExtLink.astro";
export const components = { a: ExtLink };

Djazztro combines the versatility of [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
with the elegance of the [Astro](https://astro.build) static site generator.

I thought about this project a lot before I made it. I loved how Django handled
everything backend, and Astro's way of handling frontend, so I tried to combine
the two.
In the end, I'm semi-happy with how it turned out, good experience with packaging
[Python packages](https://pypi.org/project/django-djazztro/)
and [NPM packages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/djazztro),
as well as making some GitHub actions
to automate it all.

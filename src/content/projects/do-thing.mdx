Do Thing is (another) cross-platform to-do app. This was a pretty simple project
where I just wanted to mess around with networking, web dev, and app development.

Do Thing Consists Of:

-   [Do Thing Server](https://github/Bwc9876/DoThingServer)
-   [Do Thing Auth](https://github/Bwc9876/DoThingAuth)
-   [Do Thing Web](https://github/Bwc9876/DoThingWeb)
-   [Do Thing Android](https://github/Bwc9876/DoThingAndroid)

The name of each is pretty self-explanatory, Server is the main server that
stores data, Auth takes care of authentication, and Web and Android act as front-ends.

This project was a learning experience in a lot of stuff, It doesn't have many
practical uses but it helped me learn a bit about different systems interoperate.

It also fulfilled the requirement to make a to-do app as a rite of passage
to being a developer.

import ExtLink from "@components/ExtLink.astro";
export const components = { a: ExtLink };

This was a social studies project I decided to get creative with.
It's a website outlining what the enigma machine is and even has a
recreation of it in [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/).

The site itself is pretty simple, with no CSS frameworks or anything,
but it gets the point across.

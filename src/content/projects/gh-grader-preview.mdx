A simple CLI that ran the GitHub autograder for me.

I simply got tired of having to push, wait, change, push, wait, ad nauseum. So I decided to make a solution that let me run the grader locally based on the `autograding.json` file in the `.github` folder of all repos that I have for school.

The only potential issue I can see with it is I'm using a different regex flavor (rust) than the one GitHub's autograder most likely uses (JavaScript). However most regexes my instructors put for the grader have worked fine.

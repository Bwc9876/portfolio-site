Menagerie is a simple SSG framework for generating documentation sites from
simple markdown files. It's main feature is its ability to create pages for schema
pages. It uses Python and [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/)
for generating the site,
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling, and
[json-schema-for-humans](https://github.com/coveooss/json-schema-for-humans)

This was my first public package, I learned a lot when making like how to make
python packages and designing a framework that other people will use.
It was made to create the [New Horizons Docs](https://nh.outerwildsmods.com).

import ExtLink from "@components/ExtLink.astro";
export const components = { a: ExtLink };

The config editor is a desktop I made to make editing [New Horizons](https://nh.outerwildsmods.com) config files easier. It uses React for UI and Bootstrap for styling. The forms were create with [React JSON Schema Form](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form). The backend was made with Rust and it's all tied together by [Tauri](https://tauri.app).

The app auto-generates UI from json schemas, meaning no updates are needed as New Horizons itself updates. In addition to form-based editing, it also support editing text directly with [Monaco](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) which provides a VSCode-like experience. It also validates some other things beyond simple type checking that VSCode can't do with a JSON schema.

This was my first Tauri app so i definitely made some mistakes, but it made me really like tauri and how it handled everything.

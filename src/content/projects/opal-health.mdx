(The logo for this project is for Healine,
but the project was renamed from Healine to Opal Health)

Opal Health was a telemedicine site I contributed to for the Technology Student
Association's Webmaster event. It featured a fully functional backend that
allowed patients to request appointments and doctors to accept those
appointments. Once the appointment time came, the patient and doctor could
communicate through audio and video with the web interface and also text chat.

The backend was made in [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and
the frontend was vanilla CSS (not done by me).

This project was a great learning experience for me, I got to learn how to use
[WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/), which was interesting.
I forwent using any libraries or packages when making the video chat as well so
I could learn how everything worked.
The only external library I used was [Scale Drone](https://www.scaledrone.com/)
as a way to perform [signaling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Signaling_and_video_calling#the_signaling_server).

My team members made the front end of the site, I just handled the backend and the
video chat. Overall it was a really fun project,
sadly the competition was canceled due to COVID-19.

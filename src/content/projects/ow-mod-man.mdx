import ExtLink from "@components/ExtLink.astro";
export const components = { a: ExtLink };

This was my first fully-fledged desktop app, it was made with [Tauri](https://tauri.app)
which is a frontend-agnostic application development framework that uses Rust.

For the frontend portion, I went with [React](https://react.dev/) as the UI framework
and [Pico CSS](https://picocss.com/) for styling.

It was based on the [old mod manager](https://github.com/ow-mods/ow-mod-manager)
and tried to improve functionality and Linux support.

Development took a little bit over 4 months, I made a
[core package](https://github.com/Bwc9876/ow-mod-man/tree/main/owmods_core)
so anyone can interface with mods, a
[CLI](https://github.com/Bwc9876/ow-mod-man/tree/main/owmods_cli) for
easily managing mods without a full GUI,
and a [GUI](https://github.com/Bwc9876/ow-mod-man/tree/main/owmods_gui) for
user-friendliness.

It was my first time distributing a full app to multiple sources and testing
compatibility across multiple platforms. Getting Steam Deck support via [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/com.outerwildsmods.owmods_gui)
was especially challenging.

In hindsight, I think that Pico CSS wasn't a great fit for this project as it's
more oriented towards simple static sites.
Something like Material UI might have worked better.

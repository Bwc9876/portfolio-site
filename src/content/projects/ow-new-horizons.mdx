import ExtLink from "@components/ExtLink.astro";
export const components = { a: ExtLink };

For a few years I've been contributing to New Horizons,
a modding framework for generating Outer Wilds planets from simple JSON and XML files.

Some of my contributions include:

- Adding custom ship logs
- Adding a "Reload Configs" button for refreshing JSON files without needing to
  restart the game
- Implementing various
  [CI/CD pipelines](https://github.com/Outer-Wilds-New-Horizons/new-horizons/tree/main/.github/workflows)
  with GitHub Actions.
- Implementing a schema exporter system to allow for the generation of JSON schemas
  from C# classes
- Writing & Implementing The
  [Documentation Site](https://nh.outerwildsmods.com/) (made with [menagerie](/projects/menagerie))

New Horizons was my first time working in a team and collaborating with others
on code, it took some getting used to but in the end, this project has given
me invaluable skills in being a team player.

The documentation website was also fun to implement, while I did
this part solo, the docs made me realize how much I enjoy writing
documentation and guides to help others. [Menagerie](/projects/menagerie) was
built because of the NH docs, I wanted to make a simple SSG system that supported
JSON schemas.

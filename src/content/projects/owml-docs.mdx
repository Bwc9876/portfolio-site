import ExtLink from "@components/ExtLink.astro";
export const components = { a: ExtLink };

The OWML docs were a quick project I did to try and help centralize information
about how to use OWML and mod Outer Wilds in general.

I found that there wasn't a very good "getting started" guide ad there was
outdated information on OWML's README so I decided to go and make a docs site.

It features a few guides, schemas for configs and manifests, and
a reference for how to use the `ModHelper` utility.

The site was made with [Menagerie](/projects/menagerie)
and styled a bit with [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/).

import ExtLink from "@components/ExtLink.astro";
export const components = { a: ExtLink };

This is the site you're looking at, it was made in [Astro](https://astro.build).

After using my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Bwc9876) as a portfolio for a
few years I decided to switch things up and make a site,
it was a good opportunity to learn some more about Astro's
amazing content system and other features.

Its styling is meh, but It's good enough for me and isn't _too_ atrocious.

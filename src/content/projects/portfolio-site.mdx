import ExtLink from "@components/ExtLink.astro";
export const components = { a: ExtLink };

This is the site you're looking at, it was made in [Astro](https://astro.build)
and the styling used is [Pico CSS](https://picocss.com/).

After using my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Bwc9876) as a portfolio for a
few years I decided to switch things up and make a site,
it was a good opportunity to learn some more about Astro's
amazing content system and other features.

It's styling is fairly simple, nothing too flashy.
But I'm happy with how it turned out, nice and simple.

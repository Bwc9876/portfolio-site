Quick Wheel is an app to quickly access your apps, web shortcuts,
and cmd commands fast.

It uses a weapon-wheel-like layout that overlays over everything.
It support customizing items and sorting them into folders.

This was my first desktop app, it was made using
[Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) in Python.
The UI is very simple, but it was a good learning experience in software development.

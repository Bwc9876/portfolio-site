import ExtLink from "@components/ExtLink.astro";
export const components = { a: ExtLink };

Qwerty is a small project I made when I was messing around with the new
[PyCord](https://docs.pycord.dev/) library. It uses
[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)'s ORM to provide
easy persistent storage.

I made a few commands just for fun, they include:

-   Calculator With Memory
-   Equation Solver
-   Unit Converter
-   Graphing Math Functions
-   Managing A Minecraft Server
-   Getting The Status Of A Website
-   Rolling Dice For DND
-   Generating Stock Candlestick Graphs

It was fun just making commands I was interested in and learning libraries like [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/).

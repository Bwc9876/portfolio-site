import ExtLink from "@components/ExtLink.astro";
export const components = { a: ExtLink };

This website was made for school, it was my first time [Astro](https://astro.build/)
which was neat.

Not very much to report, a pretty simple website. I went a bit crazy
with gradients in it if you couldn't tell.

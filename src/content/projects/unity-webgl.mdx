import ExtLink from "@components/ExtLink.astro";
export const components = { a: ExtLink };

This template was a way for game developers to easily deploy their Unity games
to GitHub pages.

It was mostly a way for me to learn more about GitHub actions and CD in general.

An [example game](https://bwc9876.github.io/UnityWebGL/) is
available that was made with the action.

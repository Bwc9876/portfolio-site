        I'm Ben C, a college student looking to enter software development, specifically full-stack
        web development.

      <p>
        I like to try a lot of things, from <a href="/projects/ow-new-horizons"> modding games</a>
        to building
        <a href="/projects/menagerie">websites</a> and
        <a href="/projects/ow-mod-man">desktop apps</a>.<br /> I enjoy pretty much any aspect of software
        development.

  <div class="about-section">
    <p>
      I'm a 20-year-old developer from Pennsylvania, USA. I first started programming with Unity
      games but then quickly began doing web development and then expanded into anything I was
      interested in. I've been programming for about eight years now and hope that I can continue to
      pursue a career in this industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      After programming on my own for about 3 years, I went to trade school for Information
      Technology Programming and learned about best practices and the software development life
      cycle. I participated in both SkillsUSA and TSA and was awarded 1st place in states for Video
      Game Design in TSA. I also got 1st place in Computer Programming at states and 4th at
      nationals in SkillsUSA. Throughout my time at trade school, I received my OSHA, IC3, and
      Pennsylvania State Skills (Information Technology Programming) certifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also during my time at trade school, I joined an online community of modders for the game
      Outer Wilds. This community helped me go above and beyond with my development, continually
      motivating me to try new things and publish my work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm currently in college majoring in Computer Science. I'm hoping to graduate in 2026 with a
      Bachelors and a minor in Professional Technical Writing. I am currently doing research on ASL
      translation with the Computer Science department. I'm also developing a web interface for us
      to use for programming competitions.

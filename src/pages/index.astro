    <h1>Ben C's Portfolio</h1>
    <p>
        Hi there! I'm Ben C, a prospective college student looking to enter the world of software
        development, specifically full-stack web development.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm currently set to start my college career in Computer Science at West Chester University
        in August.
    </p>
    <p>
        I like to try a lot of things, from <a href="/projects/ow-new-horizons"> modding games</a>
        to building
        <a href="/projects/menagerie">websites</a> and
        <a href="/projects/ow-mod-man">desktop apps</a>. I enjoy pretty much any aspect of software
        development.
    </p>
    <p>On this site you'll find info about me and my projects.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I'm an 18-year-old developer from Pennsylvania, USA. I first started programming with Unity
        games but then quickly began doing web development and then expanded into anything I was
        interested in. I've been programming for about six years now and hope that I can continue to
        pursue a career in this industry.
    </p>
    <p>
        I then went to trade school for Information Technology Programming and learned a lot about
        best practices and the software development life cycle. I participated in both SkillsUSA ad
        TSA as well and was awarded 1st place in states for Video Game Design in TSA, as well as 1st
        place in Computer Programming at states and 4th at nationals in SkillsUSA.
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout my time at trade school, I received my OSHA, IC3, and Pennsylvania State Skills
        (Information Technology Programming) certifications.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also during my time at trade school, I joined an online community of modders for the game
        Outer Wilds. This community helped me go above and beyond with my development, continually
        motivating me to try new things and publish my work.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'll be starting college in August at West Chester University for Computer Science, and hope
        that I can continue to expand my skill set and improve as a dev.
    </p>
    <p>
        My end goal is to work at a semi-big company and continue to contribute to open source while
        working.
    </p>
